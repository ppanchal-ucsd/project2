      <h1>Project #2 – Persuasion & Counter‑Persuasion</h1>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Pooja Panchal · <strong>Date:</strong> Oct 25, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Proposition:</strong> <em>YES: States that lost abortion clinics between 2017 and 2020 experienced significant declines in abortion rates. NO: Losing abortion clinics does not necessarily lead to lower abortion rates in some states, rates even increased despite clinic closures.</em></p>
      <p class="note">Source: Guttmacher Institute (2017–2020), rates per 1,000 women 15–44.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Creating two different visualizations from the same dataset showed me how the same numbers can tell very different stories depending on how they are presented. At first, I focused on making charts that looked clean and professional, but I quickly realized that the real challenge was making them persuasive without being misleading. Small choices, like the graph type, axis limits, and color emphasis, had a huge impact on how convincing the message appeared to be.</p>

    <p>For the "YES" chart, I chose a scatterplot because it best captured the relationship between two continuous variables: clinic loss and abortion rate change. The trend line provided a clear way to show that, overall, states that lost more clinics tended to see decreases in abortion rates. The simplicity of the scatterplot made the pattern easy to interpret and believable. At the same time, I knew that truncating the axis and highlighting the downward points could make the trend seem stronger than it really was. I considered this partially deceptive, but intentionally included it to explore how subtle exaggeration affects perception.</p>

    <p>For the "NO" chart, I used a horizontal bar chart to compare states individually. This format was deliberate because it allows readers to focus on specific cases that contradict the expected trend, like states where abortion rates rose despite fewer clinics. Sorting the bars from highest to lowest change made the message obvious at a glance, and color contrast drew the viewer’s attention toward the most unexpected outcomes. These design choices were persuasive but not fully honest, since the chart visually downplays states that followed the expected pattern. I wanted to test how framing can guide interpretation even when the data are unchanged.</p>

    <p>This project pushed me to think about ethics in visualization more deeply. I have learned that a chart’s effectiveness is not just about accuracy but also about intent. Ethical design, to me, means giving viewers enough context to understand the data while still engaging them visually. A visualization becomes unethical when it hides critical information or frames data so strongly that it misleads rather than informs.</p>
