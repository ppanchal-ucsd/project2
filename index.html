      <h1>Project #2 – Persuasion & Counter‑Persuasion</h1>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Pooja Panchal · <strong>Date:</strong> Oct 25, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Proposition:</strong> <em>YES: States that lost abortion clinics between 2017 and 2020 experienced significant declines in abortion rates. NO: Losing abortion clinics does not necessarily lead to lower abortion rates — in some states, rates even increased despite clinic closures.</em></p>
      <p class="note">Source: Guttmacher Institute (2017–2020), rates per 1,000 women 15–44.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Making two different visualizations from the same dataset helped me understand how much design choices can shape a story. It was pretty easy to make charts that looked nice, but harder to make them persuasive without crossing into misleading territory. I was surprised by how small changes-like axis limits or color could completely change how someone reads the data.

      For the “YES” chart, I focused on showing that clinic losses led to lower abortion rates. That part felt straightforward, but I realized that even an honest-looking trend line can subtly push a message. For the “NO” chart, it was trickier because I had to make the opposite point. I used color and sorting to draw attention to states where abortion rates rose even with fewer clinics. That chart looked convincing, but I knew it left out some context, so I gave it a slightly deceptive score.
      
      This project made me think more about the ethics of data visualization. I now see ethical design as being persuasive while still letting the viewer find the truth if they look carefully. A visualization crosses the line when it hides or distorts the data to support one side. My goal going forward is to design visuals that inform first, and persuade second-so that people can trust what they see.</p>
